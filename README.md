## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Screen viewports per design provided are 375px and 1440px, however my solution caters beyond that...

## My process
Started planning the project by glancing through the design and identifying utility classes, classes that are local to certain components and the general structure of the layout.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

CSS and Background crept back up in a more challenging way, I decide to challenge myself with Grid and advanced positioning.
